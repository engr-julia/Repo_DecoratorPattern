## Problem Statement

CIMB is a digital bank that offers GSave and UpSave savings accounts. As with a typical Savings Account, it contains an accountNumber, accountName, and a balance for that account.

- The typical savings account offers an interest rate of **1%**.  
  Benefits: **"Standard Savings Account"**

- The GSave account offers an interest rate of **2.5%**.  
  Benefits: **Standard Savings Account + "GCash Transfer"**

- The UpSave account offers the highest interest rate of **4.0%**.  
  Benefits: **Standard Savings Account + "With Insurance"**

A **Decorator Pattern** must be implemented following the UML diagram.  
`Cimb.java` must NOT be modified except the package name.
