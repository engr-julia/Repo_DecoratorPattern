- The typical savings account offers an interest rate of **1%**.  
  Benefits: **"Standard Savings Account"**

- The GSave account offers an interest rate of **2.5%**.  
  Benefits: **Standard Savings Account + "GCash Transfer"**

- The UpSave account offers the highest interest rate of **4.0%**.  
  Benefits: **Standard Savings Account + "With Insurance"**
